# Decision trees from scratch

This project was aimed at writing decision trees (and tree-based models such as random forest) from scratch for `Object programming and Design` classes at univeristy.

To use this project create a python virtual enviroment, once it's activated execute the following command from the main directory:
* `sh install.sh`

Sample results are present in the [demo notebook](https://github.com/wkondrusiewicz/decision_trees/blob/master/demo/test_models.ipynb). Also this repository makes use of two datasets:
* [wifi_locations](https://github.com/wkondrusiewicz/decision_trees/blob/master/demo/wifi_localization.txt) which can be obtained at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00422/
* [boston_housing](https://github.com/wkondrusiewicz/decision_trees/blob/master/demo/BostonHousing.csv) available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing
